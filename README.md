To get these files to run just get rid of the line package questions. I did these on eclipse and that program requires it.
To download the files just click the clone or download button on the repository and download it as a zip

For NameAge I used input.next because it said to print out a name, not a full name so if you enter a first and last name it wont work but Yes I know that input.nextLine would let me print both, the question just didnt specify.
